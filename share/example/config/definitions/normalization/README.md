#Data Driven Normalization
=========================

Several methods to extract normalization factors (NFs) are available 
and described in the following.

Usage
--------------------

The configuration and scheduling of different calculations uses 
the TQFolder syntax. Each top-level folder corresponds to one 
calculation step and method. The order of folders determines the
order in which the calculations are performed.

High-level settings like number of toy experiments (to propagate 
statistical uncertainties of the numbers entering the calculations)
can be found in the master configuration file. Details on the uncertainty
propagation can be found in the 'Advanced' section below.

So called 'Scale Schemes' are names for different sets of NFs. NFs written to
the Scale Scheme '.default' are automatically applied when creating cutflows or 
plots of histograms unless a different Scale Scheme is explicitly specified 
in that regard. In the context of NF calculators a 'readScaleScheme' refers to the
Scale Scheme applied when a NF calculator retrieves its input values. 
A 'writeScaleScheme' specifies the name under which a NF calculator deposits the 
results of its calculation (some calculators have multiple writeScaleSchemes in 
order to also write out some intermediate results, these are usualy not meaningful
as actual NFs). Finally, when using multiple NF calculators in sequence each result
deposited can be either applied on top of an already existing one (for the same 
process and cut), i.e., setting it to `old x new` or it can simply replace the 
existing NF. This is usually controlled by the option `<overwrite=true>` (in this 
case replacing potentially existing NFs).

In the following, unless indicated otherwise, event yields in data are
considered after subtraction of MC based yields from processes which are 
held fixed within a certain calculation (but potentially taking NF from 
previous steps into account). Often these fixed processes need to be 
explicitly listed (see examples below).

Existing NF calculation methods are described in the following, options 
can be rather specific to a particular NF Calculator:
* TQABCDCalculator: computes a NF scaling the yields in region A (usually the signal region)
    is equal to A=B*C/D.

Advanced: Details on Toys and Iterative Calculations
--------------------

In order to propagate statistical uncertainties from both, predictions and (control region) data to the resulting NFs a toy based approach is taken. To this end the chain of calculations is repeated multiple times (the number of toys can be specified by the user, typically via the master configuration file). During each repetition the different calculators obtain a random variation for each of their input values according to the statistical uncertainty of that quantity (assuming a gaussian distribution). This variation is centrally managed such that within one toy it is consistent between multiple uses (typically identified by the combination of cut and process).

If multiple, potentially different steps are used a dependency on the order of calculations can arise due to the subtraction of processes which are considered fixed in one step but are to be normalized in another.  To overcome this the framework can be instructed to run a chain of NF calculations serveral times. The number of these iterations (default: 1) can again (typically) be controlled from the master config file.

In combination with toys the iterations are performed within the context of each individual toy computation, i.e., in pseudo code:
```
foreach toy t:
    forach iteration i:
        runCalculationChain;
    gatherResults;
    resetForNextToy;
```
