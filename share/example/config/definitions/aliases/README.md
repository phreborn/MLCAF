Aliases
=========================

Aliases are string translations that you can use to keep your config files lightweight and human-readable. They are parsed by the python `configparser` module and follow the [corresponding syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#quick-start). 

You can use them to globally map placeholders to arbitrarily complicated string expressions.
